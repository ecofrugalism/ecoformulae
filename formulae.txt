photovoltaïcs
Standard PV sizes are:
65 x 39 inch = 165,1 x 99,06 cm = 16354,8 cm² = 1,63548 m²
75 x 39 inch = 198,2 x 99,06 cm = 19633,7 cm² = 1,96337 m²


Energy in solar rays

hydro
height (in meter) x flow (in liter/second) x gravity (9,81) x turbine efficieny rate = electricity production


wind turbines

energy storage
--------------

hydro
weight (in Newton) x height (in meter) x 0,0000002 = energy stored (in kWh)



Notes
For the energy storage (hydro):
if you want to culaculate a weight of water expresssed in m³, know that 1 m³ = 1000 liter water = 1000 kg
the weight in Newton can then be calculated by multiplying the weight in kg x 9,81
