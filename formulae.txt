electricity production
-----------------

solar (photovoltaïcs)
electricity production in watt, per day = solar irradiation per hour (in watt, per m²) x hours of "full sun" per day x PV panel efficiency

standard PV panel sizes are:
65 x 39 inch = 165,1 x 99,06 cm = 16354,8 cm² = 1,63548 m²
75 x 39 inch = 198,2 x 99,06 cm = 19633,7 cm² = 1,96337 m²

hydro
height (in meter) x flow (in liter/second) x gravity (9,81) x turbine efficieny rate = electricity production

wind
electricity production per second = 0,5 x swept area (in m²) x air density (=1,23) x velocity (in meter/second)³

energy storage

batteries: see other repo

hydro
weight (in Newton) x height (in meter) x 0,0000002 = energy stored (in kWh)


Notes
For the electricity production (solar):

For the electricity production (wind):
swept area is calculated by (rotor diameter/2)² x 3,14
air density is 1,23 only at sea level
the "system efficiency" will typically be very poor (say 25%) due to the Betz limit and other losses

For the energy storage (hydro):
if you want to culaculate a weight of water expresssed in m³, know that 1 m³ = 1000 liter water = 1000 kg
the weight in Newton can then be calculated by multiplying the weight in kg x 9,81
The 0,0000002 comes from the fact that 1 kWh = 3600000J
